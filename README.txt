ANGULARJS UNIT TESTING:

- Make one folder named “Myapp” and copy the files: scope.html, controller.js and angular.min.js
- Create directory “test” for creating test files (Myapp/test/*.js)
- Copy test.js to Myapp/test/
 or from here (https://github.com/AubergineSolutions/AngularJSUnitTesting)
- You can also clone this project(only if you have git installed) by running: git clone https://github.com/AubergineSolutions/AngularJSUnitTesting.git
- Install node.js from http://nodejs.org/ or install through command line:
	
FOR MAC:
	
	- If you're using the excellent homebrew (http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) package manager, you can install node with one command: “brew install node”
	- Otherwise, follow the below steps:
	- Install Xcode.(https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
	- Install git.(https://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/)
	- Run the following commands:
	- git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
	  cd node
	 ./configure
	 make
	 sudo make install

For WINDOWS:
	- Currently, you must use cygwin to install node. To do so, follow these steps:
	- Install cygwin.
	- Use setup.exe in the cygwin folder to install the following packages:
	  devel -> openssl
	  devel -> g++-gcc
	  devel -> make
	  python -> python
	  devel -> git
	- Open the cygwin command line with Start > Cygwin > Cygwin Bash Shell.
	- Run the below commands to download and build node.
	  git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
	  cd node
	  ./configure
	  make
	  sudo make install

For UBUNTU:

	- Install the dependencies:
	- sudo apt-get install g++ curl libssl-dev apache2-utils
	- sudo apt-get install git-core
	- Run the following commands:
   	  git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
	  cd node
	  ./configure
	  make
	  sudo make install

- To verify installation, type “node” through command line
- Now verify npm installation , type "npm" through command line

- Install karma through npm :
  First navigate to the app folder (cd C:/…/Myapp)
  Type  “npm install karma”
	
- Install jasmine
  Type “npm install karma-jasmine”

- Install karma chrome launcher to run the test
  “npm install karma-chrome-launcher”
	
- Install karma Firefox launcher to run the test
  “npm install karma-firefox-launcher “
	
- Install bower for plugins
  “npm install bower”

Note: Bower requires Node and npm and Git.
      
- Install angular-mocks through bower
  ”bower install angular-mocks”

- To run the App, you just need to run the “scope.html” file present in the Myapp folder.
- To run the test-cases, you need to follow the steps given below:
	- Create a config file [karma.conf.js] in the app folder :-
	  -Using command prompt navigate to the folder in which your app is present (e.g: cd C:/…/Myapp)
	  -Now run the command “karma init”, and follow the steps given below: 
	
	   1. Which testing framework do you want to use? Press tab to list possible options. Enter to move to the next question.
> jasmine
	   2. Do you want to use Require.js? This will add Require.js plugin. Press tab to list possible options. Enter to move to the next question.
> no
	   3. Do you want to capture any browsers automatically? Press tab to list possible options. Enter empty string to move to the next question.
> Chrome
> Firefox
	   4. What is the location of your source and test files? You can use glob patterns, eg. "js/*.js" or "test/**/*Spec.js". Enter empty string to move to the next question.
> angular.min.js
> bower_components/angular-mocks/angular-mocks.js
> controller.js
> test/test.js
	   5. Should any of the files included by the previous patterns be excluded? You can use glob patterns, eg. "**/*.swp". Enter empty string to move to the next question.
>
	   6. Do you want Karma to watch all the files and run the tests on change? Press tab to list possible options.
> yes

Config file generated at "C:\...\Myapp\karma.conf.js".

- Now run the command “karma start karma.conf.js” to run the config file (which will run the test-cases present in the test.js file).


NOTE:
-Before running the testcases, the below points should be kept in mind:
	-> The controller should be defined after the instantiation of the module, otherwise it will result to the following error: 
Error: [$injector:nomod] Module 'myModule' is not available!
	-> The module being loaded in your test file should be present in the javascript file, which uses the controller for running the testcases.
If module is not properly loaded than it will result to the error: 
AngularJS Unit Testing - TypeError: Cannot read property of null
	-> angular and angular-mocks file should be of same version
	-> Multiple loading or duplication of angular.min.js file will result in incorrect module dependency
